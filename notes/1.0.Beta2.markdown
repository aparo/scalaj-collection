1.0 Beta2 release:

* Changed signature of Map#foreach to take a function of a Tuple2 rather than a Function2
* Added support for Comparable, Comparator, Ordered, and Ordering
* Coercible no longer subclasses Function1 (to prevent accidentally putting implicit conversions in scope)
* Wrappers are now @serializable if the underlying collection is @serializable

Special thanks to Daniel Spiewak and Michel Salim, who provided the feedback that led to most of the improvements in this release.
